This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

ellorra.ai is a frontend-focused project emphasizing distinctive, production-grade interface design that avoids generic AI aesthetics.

## Core Design Philosophy

When building frontend components or interfaces in this project:

**Aesthetic Direction**: Always commit to a bold, distinctive aesthetic direction before coding. Options include:
- Brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural
- Luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw
- Art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian

**Critical Design Elements**:
- **Typography**: Use distinctive, characterful fonts (avoid Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- **Color**: Commit to cohesive palettes with dominant colors and sharp accents; use CSS variables
- **Motion**: High-impact animations using CSS-only for HTML, Motion library for React
- **Spatial Composition**: Embrace asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow, grid-breaking elements
- **Visual Details**: Create atmosphere through gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows

**Avoid**:
- Generic AI aesthetics (purple gradients on white, cookie-cutter patterns)
- Converging on common choices (Space Grotesk, predictable layouts)
- Same design twice - vary themes, fonts, and aesthetics

**Implementation Principle**: Match code complexity to aesthetic vision:
- Maximalist designs → elaborate code with extensive animations
- Minimalist designs → restraint, precision, careful spacing/typography

## Skill System

This repository uses a skill-based approach defined in `SKILL.md`. The `frontend-design` skill guides creation of distinctive interfaces with:
- Production-grade functional code
- Visually striking and memorable design
- Cohesive aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulous detail refinement

## Development Context

Before implementing any interface:
1. Understand purpose and audience
2. Choose an extreme tonal direction
3. Identify technical constraints
4. Define the unforgettable differentiating element
5. Execute with precision and intentionality
